Validations/DataAnnotation in ASP.Net MVC Web Applications:
- Validation is nothing but verifying user's input.
- There are two types of validations for a web application
	- Client Side Validations
	- Server Side Validations
- Client side validations can be performed at browser level by using JavaScript and it's related libraries.
- Implmenting only client side validations is not sufficiant for an web application, so that we will use server side validations.
- In ASP.Net MVC, to implement server side validations we use "Data Annotations".
- Data Annotations are the attribute classes, which can be applied to Model class properties.
- There are different validation attributes/ Data annotations are avaible like
	[required]
	[StringLength]
	[Compare]
	[EmailAddress] etc.
- While working with Data Annotation we need to follow below steps
	- Identify and apply the Data annotations for Model class properties.
	- Verify the Model State with the Post Request of a Controller by using		(ModelState.IsValid)
	- Specify the validation mesages for every input control by using 		following HTML Helper methods
		@Html.ValidationMessage()
		@Html.ValidationSummery()
- ModelState is a property which wil takecare of state of the Model, where state means currently available data.

Custom Validations:
- It is nothing but creating our own validation attribute classes.
- If all the data annotations are not meet the requirements, then we can create our own data annotation class, and every class is an attribute class.
Steps to work:
- Create a class by suffix with "Attribute"
- Inherit the class by using "ValidationAttribute"
- Provide the mandatory prameter values using Constructor.
- Implement the overriding functionality of a virtual method i.e. "IsValid()"
